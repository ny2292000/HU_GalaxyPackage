Title: The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory: A Novel Paradigm in Cosmology

Abstract: The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU) presents a new model for understanding the Universe's development and properties, differing from conventional models that rely on inflationary scenarios. The HU framework explains the homogeneity, expansion, and composition of the Universe through fundamental concepts such as the 4D Spatial Manifold, the hyperspherical shell, the Fundamental Dilator, and the Quantum Lagrangian Principle. In this paper, we discuss the key features of HU, contrasting them with other cosmological models, and highlighting the advantages of HU, including energy conservation and a simplified description of the Universe's evolution.

    Introduction

Conventional cosmological models often rely on inflationary scenarios to explain the early Universe's expansion, homogeneity, and isotropy. However, these models may require unsupported hypotheses, such as false vacuum decay and the inflaton field. The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU) offers an alternative framework that simplifies the description of the Universe's evolution and properties, as well as preserving energy conservation.

    The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory: Key Concepts

2.1 The 4D Spatial Manifold and Hyperspherical Shell

The HU model proposes that the Universe is a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical hypersurface in a 4D Spatial Manifold. The Universe's development begins with the Initial Hyperspherical Metric Fluctuation, driven by the Heisenberg Principle, which leads to the creation of a perfectly smooth hyperspherical shell called the Outermost Contraction Layer (OCL).

2.2 The Fundamental Dilator

Particles in the HU framework are polymers of the Fundamental Dilator, a coherence between two stationary states of deformation of space. These states correspond to the electron and proton phases, which cycle through all four phases: electron, perpendicular proton, positron, and perpendicular antiproton. The perpendicular phases have minimal interaction with our 3D Universe, as they have very small 3D footprints.

2.3 The Quantum Lagrangian Principle

In HU, particles move into locations where they are in phase with the local dilaton field, replacing Newton's laws of dynamics with the Quantum Lagrangian Principle (QLP). This principle allows for a simplified description of particle interactions and motion in the HU framework.

    Cosmogenesis in the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory

3.1 The Big Pop and the Blackholium

Following the Initial Hyperspherical Metric Fluctuation, a partial recombination occurs, leading to the creation of a Blackholium - a hyperspherically shell-shaped Black Hole. The subsequent fragmentation of the Blackholium's smooth OCL results in the formation of Flat Hydrogen, setting the stage for the evolution of matter in the Universe.

3.2 Neutronium Phase and the Cosmic Microwave Background

The Blackholium-Neutronium phase transition allows for the creation of neutrons, neutrinos, and antineutrinos, along with the triggering of hyperspherical harmonic acoustic modes called Neutronium Oscillations. These oscillations lead to the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, which serves as a record of density fluctuations in the early Universe.

    The Silver Surfer Paradigm for Motion

The Silver Surfer Paradigm for Motion in the HU model reimagines particles' 3D volumes, or the Fabric of Space, as surfboards. The orientation of these volumes with respect to the radial direction defines their tangential velocity. This paradigm recasts Newton's laws of dynamics in terms of Space Strain-Stress, mapping force to stress, area to mc^2, and strain to the rate of change of the hyperbolic tangent of the angle alpha.


    Advantages of the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory over Other Models

5.1 Energy Conservation

One of the main advantages of the HU model is that it conserves energy. The negative energy is contained within the Inner Dilation Layer (IDL), which balances the positive energy of the Outermost Contraction Layer (OCL). This conservation of energy makes the HU framework more consistent with fundamental physical principles compared to other cosmological models.

5.2 Simplified Description of the Universe's Evolution

The HU model offers a more straightforward explanation for the Universe's development, relying solely on space, deformation of space, and time. This simplicity makes it easier to understand and model the Universe's properties, in contrast to more complex inflationary scenarios that involve multiple fields and unsupported hypotheses.

5.3 Homogeneity and Isotropy Explained without Inflation

The HU model explains the homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe without requiring an inflationary period. The Universe is homogeneous because it began as a perfectly smooth hyperspherical shell (the OCL). This feature sets the HU model apart from conventional inflationary scenarios, which often require additional mechanisms to generate the observed large-scale uniformity.

5.4 Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry

The HU model accounts for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter by considering a phase shift in the Fundamental Dilator coherence. The smooth nature of the OCL during the Big Pop allows for the creation of only matter (not antimatter), leading to a uniform distribution of matter in the Universe. This explanation provides a more natural solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem than other cosmological models.

    Conclusion

The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory presents a novel approach to understanding the Universe's development and properties. It offers a simplified framework that relies on key concepts such as the 4D Spatial Manifold, the hyperspherical shell, the Fundamental Dilator, and the Quantum Lagrangian Principle. By preserving energy conservation and providing a more intuitive explanation for the Universe's homogeneity, isotropy, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, the HU model represents a significant step forward in our understanding of cosmology. Further research and analysis will continue to shed light on the implications of the HU model and its potential to reshape our understanding of the Universe.
