There is a theory that reproduces Einstein's successes and avoids Einstein's failures and that is Quantum Mechanical... It is called The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU).

Here I created a map for the observable and unobservable Universe and located Earth on it: https://www.quora.com/According-to-the-Hypergeometrical-Universe-Theory-HU-where-is-our-universe-within-the-hyperspherical-hypersurface/answer/Marco-Pereira-1?ch=2&srid=3aDA

Here is how I created the map of the Hyperspherical Universe from the knowledge obtained by the Planck Satellite: 3D galaxy density map of the current universe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLqkbCAzcJM

and here is how I challenged Einstein's theory: https://www.quora.com/How-would-anyone-defend-general-relativity-from-Marco-Pereiras-HU-challenge/answer/Marco-Pereira-1

Here is my take on the Dark Stuff: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-status-as-of-2019-of-the-search-for-dark-matter/answer/Marco-Pereira-1
