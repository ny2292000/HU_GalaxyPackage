__description__ = "This package introduces the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU) Galaxy Formation model \
It is based on the physical reasoning that during galaxy formation most of the matter flow (drift) \
will come along the vertical direction (along the axis of rotation).  \
The reason is Angular Momentum Conservation. It is a good approximation to consider \
that the initial radial mass distributions will keep their initial rotation curve \
since mass drift will be happening mostly along the vertical direction \
HU derived a Law of Gravitation where Newton's Gravitational Constant G is inversely proportional \
to the 4D radius and thus epoch-dependent. \
This package allows one to assign the birth of the galaxy to different epochs (or redshifts z) and \
follow the galaxy evolution. \
At the same time mass drifts vertically according to the Drude Model, G also changes. \
Star Spectrum depends upon the hydrostatic column pressure and that is defined not just by the \
star's mass but also by the value of G. \
In other words, It is possible for a star start with a smaller mass and gain mass without changing its color. \
That will happen if the drift matches the change in G value. \
Since the drift velocity is defined by the vertical gravitational acceleration (G proportional) times the \
time between collisions, then that is assured. \
In other words, there is a Epoch Covariance on Star Evolution."
